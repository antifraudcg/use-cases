## Introduction

Our goal is to capture a non-exhaustive, but highly diverse list of fraud and abuse that
has at least partial reliance on online workflows/technologies that are in the scope of
the W3C Anti-Fraud Community Group (CG). The CG will use this to help focus future
discussions and proposals, but just because a certain abuse tactic or fraud method is
not explicitly included does not mean that it is out of scope for the CG.

## Use Cases

### Account Creation

Account authentication and account creation workflows are abused from bad actors who manually or programmatically attempt to create accounts that they can subsequently use to abuse a platform.

Bad actors misrepresent their identities during the account creation process. There are three main approaches, known in the fraud industry as:

* **Identity theft** - wherein a bad actor claims to be somebody that they are not, using a legitimate identity that was previously compromised
* **Synthetic identity** - wherein a bad actor uses a combination of fake and real identity attributes to create a new ‘synthetic’ identity that can be partially verified, thus bypassing verification controls
* **1st party fraud** - wherein a person submits their own data, perhaps with minor alterations and then subsequently claims to be a victim of identity theft.

### Account Takeover

Bad actors use a variety of techniques to obtain access to an account. Once an account is compromised, user credentials or profile data (address, email, phone, etc) are often modified to elongate the window of opportunity for abuse. Changes to account profile attributes or passwords are often the first sign that an account has been hijacked. From there, bad actors can instigate all sorts of financial crimes, which are naturally specific to the compromised institutions. This includes payments fraud, crypto-jacking, online ecommerce, benefits fraud, and compromised lines of credit.

#### Credential Cracking

See [OAT-007 Credential Cracking](https://owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/assets/oats/EN/OAT-007_Credential_Cracking.html).

#### Credential Stuffing

See [OAT-008 Credential Stuffing](https://owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/assets/oats/EN/OAT-008_Credential_Stuffing.html).

#### Phishing

Phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent (e.g., spoofed, fake, or otherwise deceptive) message designed to trick a person into revealing sensitive information to the attacker or to deploy malicious software on the victim's infrastructure like ransomware ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing))

#### Token Theft

Session credentials for authenticated users are traditionally stored as cookies, which are trivially extracted by malware running with user privileges. Services traditionally defend against this by associating certain invariant client properties (screen size, webGL renderer, etc) with a user’s cookie, and rejecting the session credential (forcing the use to re-authenticate) if it appears that the cookie is used on a new device.

### Invalid Traffic (IVT) in Advertising

Invalid traffic is any activity that doesn't come from a real user with genuine interest. It can include accidental clicks caused by intrusive ad implementations, fraudulent clicking by competing advertisers, advertising botnets and more (per [Google’s](https://www.google.com/ads/adtrafficquality/invalid-activity) definition).

See [TAG IVT Taxonomy](https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/2848641/Invalid%20Traffic%20Taxonomy%20(IVT)/IVT%20Taxonomy%20v2.0.pdf) and [Invalid Traffic Detection and Filtration Standards Addendum](http://mediaratingcouncil.org/IVT%20Addendum%20Update%20062520.pdf) for more details in the underlying threat models in advertising.

### Ecommerce Fraud

Automation is used to abuse the purchase workflows of digital or physical goods. Bad actors are able to complete purchases faster (e.g. sneaker bots, auction sniping) and at larger quantities compared to other buyers.

#### Scalping

See [OAT-005 Scalping](https://owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/assets/oats/EN/OAT-005_Scalping.html).

#### Sniping

See [OAT-013 Sniping](https://owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/assets/oats/EN/OAT-013_Sniping.html).

### Payment Fraud

Payment workflows are abused using automated or manual techniques in order to buy merchandise using stolen payment cards, validate stolen payment cards, brute force and crack payment cards, or abuse promotions.

#### Carding

See [OAT-001 Carding](https://owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/assets/oats/EN/OAT-001_Carding.html).

#### Card Cracking

See [OAT-010 Card Cracking](https://owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/assets/oats/EN/OAT-010_Card_Cracking.html).

#### Cashing Out

Fraud in eCommerce channels typically takes advantage of compromised credit cards, or compromised accounts linked to credit cards. Fraudsters will purchase high value items such as laptops with the intent of reselling them. As a result, merchants incur ‘doubled’ losses - the loss of the merchandise and then another loss due to a payment chargeback. In other cases, fraudsters utilize these schemes to purchase gift cards which are then resold on various marketplaces. Gift cards are often employed as a money laundering tactic, and as means of converting stolen credit cards to cash.

Fraudsters frequently employ remailer services in order to cover their tracks. Remailers are innocent 3rd parties who provide an address for shipping and then send the goods on to another location.

Also see [OAT-012 Cashing Out](https://owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/assets/oats/EN/OAT-012_Cashing_Out.html).

#### Promotion Abuse

Brands will frequently offer promotions to accelerate adoption by new users. Once fraud rings realize that they can successfully exploit sign up flows at scale, they begin to target these organizations with high volumes of new accounts, in order to reap promotional benefits.

Paypal was recently the victim of such an attack. Paypal announced that 4.5 million fake accounts were created to take advantage of a promotion where new users received a free balance of $5 or $10. Paypal announced this in the Q4 2021 earnings call. This news, along with slow growth in legitimate users, was followed by a 25% drop in stock price.

### Sensitive Data Scraping

Sensitive data (e.g. user profiles, product prices, user generated content) that is available in the public domain (account authentication may or may not be required) is programmatically exfiltrated at scale for use elsewhere.

#### Scraping

See [OAT-011 Scraping](https://owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/assets/oats/EN/OAT-011_Scraping.html).

### Online Spam & Fake Engagements

Mass spammy user generated content (videos, reviews, comments, likes, audio/video playback). Bypassing creator's restrictions on accessing content. A particular subclass is fake engagement where the attacker wishes to inflate (or deflate) the listing’s reputation or ranking via automated, inorganic engagement with the page.  Engagements may be active (e.g. A click) or passive (e.g. an impression, or time spent on site). In some cases, filtration decisions need to be made in real-time (e.g. to report live-stream concurrent viewership).

Fake engagements may be _simulated _(i.e. generated by something other than the claimed platform), _automated_ or _hijacked _(i.e. generated on the claimed platform, but without genuine user intent), or _incentivized_ (i.e. generated by a human in exchange for an undisclosed incentive).

#### Skewing

See [OAT-016 Skewing](https://owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/assets/oats/EN/OAT-016_Skewing.html).

#### Spamming

See [OAT-017 Spamming](https://owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/assets/oats/EN/OAT-017_Spamming.html).

### Denial of Service

Unwanted traffic sent for the purpose of making a service unavailable for legitimate users.

#### Denial of Service

See [OAT-015 Denial of Service](https://owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/assets/oats/EN/OAT-015_Denial_of_Service).

### Theft of Intellectual Property

Attackers are sometimes after the developer’s intellectual property. It may materialize as scraping the developer’s database (product catalog, map tiles, search results), or re-selling the service under a different brand (e.g. video stream pulled into a foreign player).

### Unauthorized access

Attackers seeking private data (e.g. bearer tokens, passwords, form entries, emails) belonging to a user will attempt to compromise the system holding this data. In addition to the mechanisms listed in the “account takeover” category, this may be possible through malware or exploitation of security bugs. 

## Capabilities

### Motivation

Many of the heterogenous use cases listed above are rooted in common patterns of deception: For example, DoS, invalid ad traffic, and bulk account creation are amplification attacks (i.e. a small number of users presenting as many distinct users) with vastly different latency requirements (i.e. how much time we have to decide whether to reject or accept a request).

Owners of these disparate use cases may ask a common set of questions, for example: Are these N requests coming from \~N distinct clients? Are intentional users making these requests? Are these users coordinating with the intent to deceive? 

Such questions are answerable if the defender has the requisite “capabilities,” each of which provides a specific inference that may be enforced upon on its own, or in combination with inferences from complementary capabilities. These capabilities may be backed by a variety of sources of truth, including high-entropy client signals, hardware integrity checks, white-box cryptography, reputation ledgers, and other relevant technologies yet to be identified. 

### Enumeration of Capabilities

This section lists the capabilities that we have identified as useful for our key use cases. (Think of these as the requirements we have for our key use cases, deferring implementation opportunities or challenges to a subsequent design proposal)

### Qualities of Capabilities

Capabilities should be unambiguous and specific in their inference, avoiding broad qualitative verdicts in favor of specific attestations or refutations (e.g. a boolean verdict attesting to a specific fact). The utility of a capability for a specific use case may be contingent upon certain criteria, such as latency (how quickly can I get an answer?), accuracy (how many false positives/negatives can by use case tolerate?), friction (can I potentially interrupt the user, or do I need a passive assertion?), and others.

## Glossary
* **Manual fraud** - Fraud executed manually by a human without the use of software, scripts, or other tools that automate the process.
* **Remailers** - An anonymous remailer is a server that receives messages with embedded instructions on where to send them next, and that forwards them without revealing where they originally came from.
